# Video 1 (How to Choose a Programming Language)

How exactly do you choose a first programming to learn? Why PHP, and not Ruby? And what about JavaScript or Python? How can you possibly be expected to make an educated decision at this early stage of your learning?

you don't have to learn every language in real world. its depend on what language you need to learn. it's the same thing in programming languages so have to learn that langauge which you need the most.

when you learn one language the basic concept of all programming languages are the same then you can learn every language.

Laravel and wordpress === PHP
Shopify === Ruby
